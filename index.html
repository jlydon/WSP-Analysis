<h1 id="intent">Site Intent</h1>

	<div class="right_align">
	<h2>Project Analysis Overview</h2>
	
		<p>The homepage for Primrose Center, Inc leaves much to be desired.
			The goal is to make the site more welcoming. This can easily be 
			done by correcting some validation errors, arranging content in a 
			meaningful way, and improving the overall user experiance by 
			arranging navigation elements in a less redundant way.</p>
	</div><div class="clear_fix"></div>
	
	<div class="right_align">
	<h2>W3C Validation Errors</h2>
	
		<p>Primrose Center fails the W3C validation with 26 markup errors and
			0 CSS errors. 26 Markup errors is just poor practice and this site
			only passes a CSS validation because it has little style to validate.
			These errors need to be addressed and some creativity added to the style.</p>
	</div><div class="clear_fix"></div>
	
	<div class="right_align">
	<h2>Content &amp Presentation</h2>
	
		<p>All of Primrose Center's markup is quite messy and does not take advantage
			of newer CSS3 techniques. This problem can be addressed simply by isolating
			the actual content of the site and remove anything that is not symantically
			important.</p>
	</div><div class="clear_fix"></div>
	
	<div class="right_align">
	<h2>Page Layout</h2>
		
		<p>The site displays no sign of proximity as it has both an oversized navigation
			on the left side, and a poorly styled navigation bar located under the call
			to action. The logo is far too big as it distracts the user from the content.
			Lackluster margins and padding make readability difficult. Company information
			is not promenently displayed. My solution to these problems:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Re-arrange the logo, resize it to be less intrusive</li>
					<li>Horizontal menu at the top, underneath the logo</li>
					<li>Remove aside navigation, it's redundant</li>
				</ul>
	</div><div class="clear_fix"></div>
	
	<div class="right_align">
	<h2>User Interface</h2>
	
		<p>Currently, reading Primrose Center's website is difficult on the eyes. Overly used
			gradients, limited colors, and a font library not relevent to the topic it represents.
			We will create a better user experiance by choosing a font type and color scheme that
			contrasts with the mood of the site. Organization of the call to action will
			be used to extract important data out of the site for the users easy accessablity. Backdoor
			needs to be larger and more dominantly posted.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">Competitive Analysis</h1>

	<div class="right_align">
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
		<p>www.primrosecenter.org does not have a global Alexa rank</p>
	</div><div class="clear_fix"></div>
	
	<div class="right_align">	
	<h2>Current Keywords</h2>

			<li>assisting people with</li>
			<li>disabilities center</li>
			<li>people with disabilities</li>

	<h2>Competitor Comparison</h2>
	
		<p>Primrose Center is a non-profit organization, thus "competition" is more about site hits
			than anything else. When you enter the term "people with disabilities" the following sites
			appear for having the highest Alexa Traffic Rank:</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/iu.edu">Indiana University (Rank 6,505)</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/state.mn.us">Minnesota State (Rank 11,001)</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/state.il.us">State of Illinois (Rank 12,677)</a></li>
		</ul>

			rank of 6,505. Visitors to the site view an average of 4.3 unique pages per day. Visitors to 
			the site spend roughly four minutes per visit to the site and 35 seconds per pageview. The site
			is particularly popular among users in the city of Indianapolis (where it is ranked #41). Iu.edu 
			is located in the US</p>
			
		<p><a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/state.il.us">State.il.us</a>'s three-month global Alexa 
			traffic rank is 12,677. The site has been online for more than nine years. The site's visitors
			view an average of 4.6 unique pages per day. Compared with all internet users, State.il.us's 
			users are disproportionately Caucasian, and they are disproportionately moderately educated, 
			higher-income women between the ages of 35 and 65 who browse from home. The site is located in
			the US.</p>

			according to the three-month Alexa traffic rankings, and the site has been online for at least nine
			years. The time spent in a typical visit to the site is about four minutes, with 37 seconds spent

			a traffic rank of 2,238.</p>
